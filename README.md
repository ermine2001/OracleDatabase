# Oracle-Database

The purpose of this project was to create a database based on the above information.

(1) Propose a table schema (including primary and foreign keys)

(2) Populate the tables with data

(3) Create several queries that return information similar to that in the original (unnormalized) table.

In my interpretation of the project, I used the technology of Oracle SQL Developer Data Modeler to generate a database schema and create tables in SQL language. Then, I implemented a connection to the Oracle XE server through the Oracle SQL Developer program.
